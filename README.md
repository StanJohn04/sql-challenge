# SQL_Challenge - Module 9

# Background
It has been two weeks since I was hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). My first major task is to do a research prject about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s.

I will need to design the tables to hold all the data from six CSV files, import the CSV data into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data by making SQL queries. The project is broken down into three parts: Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis.
